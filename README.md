# Search/List fields in a Service (ArcGIS)

A quick snippet of code to search for a field name in an ArcGIS service. Needed to find layers across a number of services that had a particular field, so built this as an exercise in better understanding JS Promises/creating something reusable.

It's extended from sample code here: https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/request/
